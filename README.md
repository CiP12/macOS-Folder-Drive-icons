# macOS-Folder-Drive-icons
Simple, some custom macOS folder and drive icons as .icns files.
So yeah, not much to it. If you want to use these on your Mac, go to the get info pane on the folder/drive, and paste the .icns file in. Should be pretty easy. Enjoy!

(yes I know the folder icons aren't centered)
